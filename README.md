Rime with your keystrokes.

> **This is `librime-stl`, a fork of [rime/librime](https://github.com/rime/librime).**
> It powers [term-ime](https://github.com/adam-ikari/term-ime), a TTY input method,
> and differs from upstream in three ways:
> - **Engine library artifacts for four platforms** (Linux `.so` / Windows `.dll` /
>   macOS `.dylib` / Android `.so`), consumed via the pure C API (`rime_api.h`).
> - **Boost dropped** (`std::regex` + a minimal `<rime/*.hpp>` set); **opencc
>   vendored** — the engine configure/build no longer needs a host Python or a
>   host-built `opencc_dict`. Schema patterns are translated PCRE→ECMAScript by
>   one shared helper so schemas written for upstream keep working.
> - **`dict/` is the bundled Simplified dictionary** (luna-pinyin + frequency table
>   + opencc data), published as a versioned artifact. Its generators live in
>   `dict/tools/` and are driven by explicit `make`, never by the CMake build graph.
>
> Only the dictionary is upstream-derived; the engine patches are this fork's own.

Syncing upstream
---
The engine stays a close derivative so upstream fixes keep flowing in:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/rime/librime
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master        # dict/ has no counterpart upstream; it never conflicts
```

Expect conflicts only where this fork intentionally diverges — the Boost
shims. The rule that keeps them small: **translate upstream's Boost usage at the
`#include` line** (shims live in the `boost::` namespace, so call sites are
untouched). When upstream moves a construct we cannot shim (as with Boost.PP in
commit `cbf363be`), replace it at configure time instead — that is how
`src/rime_extra_modules.h.in` came about. After merging, `make test` must be
green; `make -C dict/tools check && make -C dict/tools smoke` cover the
bundled dictionary.

The engine is [rime/librime](https://github.com/rime/librime), Copyright the RIME
Developers, distributed under the 3-Clause BSD License. This fork keeps the upstream
`LICENSE` verbatim — the engine patches are an upstream-compatible derivative, not a
relicense. Data under `dict/` is a separate matter and follows its own sources
(LGPL-3.0 for `essay.txt` and `luna_pinyin.dict.yaml`; Apache-2.0 for the OpenCC-derived
tables; MIT for this project's own tables) — see [dict/LICENSE](dict/LICENSE) and
[THIRD-PARTY.md](THIRD-PARTY.md). This repository is therefore BSD-3 for the engine plus
the retained terms of the bundled data, not a single uniform license.

Full texts are vendored under [`licenses/`](licenses/) (LGPL-3.0, GPL-3.0,

[dict/LICENSE](dict/LICENSE) for the distribution obligations.


Features
===
  - A modular, extensible input method engine in cross-platform C++ code,
    built on top of open-source technologies
  - Covering features found in a large variety of Chinese input methods,
    either shape-based or phonetic-based
  - Built with native support for Traditional Chinese, conversion to Simplified
    Chinese and other regional standards via OpenCC
  - Rime input schema, a DSL in YAML syntax for fast trying out innovative ideas
    of input method design
  - Spelling Algebra, a mechanism to create variant spelling, especially useful
    for Chinese dialects
  - Support for chord-typing with a generic Qwerty keyboard

Install
===
Follow the instructions to build librime on platforms other than Linux:
  - [macOS](https://github.com/rime/librime/tree/master/README-mac.md)
  - [Windows](https://github.com/rime/librime/tree/master/README-windows.md)
  - [Android](https://github.com/adam-ikari/librime-stl/tree/master/README-android.md)

Build dependencies
---
  - compiler with C++17 support
  - cmake>=3.12
  - libglog>=0.7 (optional)
  - libleveldb
  - libmarisa
  - libopencc>=1.0.2 (vendored under `deps/opencc`)
  - libyaml-cpp>=0.5
  - libgtest (optional)

Runtime dependencies
---
  - libglog (optional)
  - libleveldb
  - libmarisa
  - libopencc
  - libyaml-cpp

No Boost is required: this fork compiles patterns with `std::regex` and
replaces the boost facilities librime used (algorithm/string, signals2,
interprocess, crc, uuid, regex) with the minimal shims under `src/rime/*.hpp`.
Schema-supplied patterns go through a shared PCRE→ECMAScript translation
(`src/rime/pcre_translator.hpp`) so schemas written for upstream behave the
same here; see the fork note above.

Build and install on Linux
---
```
make
sudo make install
```
