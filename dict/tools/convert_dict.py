"""Regenerate dict/luna_pinyin.dict.yaml from its traditional base.

The base is the traditional snapshot committed in this repo at the SHA named by
`luna-pinyin-base` in sources.lock -- not upstream rime-luna-pinyin's current
head, which has since gained per-reading frequency weights and entries this
dictionary deliberately does not carry (Japanese national variants, the bopomofo
index). Reproducing the product means reproducing that curation, so the base is
read from git history rather than re-derived from upstream.

Contract:
  * the YAML header and its comments stay untouched -- they are prose, and
    converting them would silently traditionalize->simplify our own notes.
  * character-level t2s only, with protected characters kept.
  * drop the weight column: candidate order comes from essay.txt
    (use_preset_vocabulary), and a second, sparser frequency source in the word
    list only fights it.
  * deduplicate by (word, syllables), keeping the first reading line -- one word
    with several readings stays several lines, because typing either reading has
    to reach the word.
  * apply pinyin_fixes.txt on top of the converted base: the base is an
    upstream traditional snapshot, and a handful of its syllable strings are
    simply wrong for simplified Chinese (蚌埠市 bang fu shi). They cannot be
    fixed at the source -- the source is a pinned git object -- so the
    corrections live in a side table the generator reads every run.
  * declare the THUOCL supplement (`import_tables: [thuocl]`) in the header.
    The header is prose from the base, but this one line is a behavioural
    declaration, and leaving it out of the generator would mean hand-editing
    the product -- the gate would then diff against a file no script makes.
  * order by the whole line.
